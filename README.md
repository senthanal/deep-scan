# Deep Scan

A node app to scan and report license violations for the given npm package using OpenSource Review Toolkit(ORT)

## Motivation

Typical scenario, ORT provides possibility of setting up the company software auditing policies. Running such a ORT scan in every PR commit increases build pipeline runtime drastically. Ideally, we would like to evaluate desired npm package against those company policies before using them.
